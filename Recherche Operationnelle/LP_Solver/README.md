# 🧮 Linear Programming Solver  
**Recherche Opérationnelle – Project**

A small interactive Python application that solves **Linear Programming (LP)** problems with two variables using the **Simplex / HiGHS** algorithm from SciPy.  
It provides a clean graphical interface where you can manually enter coefficients and instantly obtain the optimal solution and an optional 2D visualization.

## 🎯 Project Objective

This project demonstrates how theoretical concepts from **Recherche Opérationnelle** (Operations Research) — such as formulation, constraints, and optimization — can be applied through programming.  
It allows students to directly experience how the Simplex method works in practice using a computational tool.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Manual data entry interface (no pre-designed problems)
- Solves problems of the form  
  **Maximize:** `Z = c1*x1 + c2*x2`  
  **Subject to:** `a1*x1 + a2*x2 ≤ b`
- Supports up to **five constraints**
- Enforces non-negativity: `x1 ≥ 0`, `x2 ≥ 0`
- Displays:
  - Optimal values of `x1`, `x2`
  - Maximum value `Zmax`
  - Iteration count and solver status
- Optional **2D plot** of constraints and the optimal point
- Can be packaged as a **stand-alone executable (.exe)** — runs without Python

## ⚙️ Installation and Execution

### ▶️ Run with Python

1. **Open a terminal** and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd "/path/to/LP_Solver_Project"
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate      # macOS / Linux
   .venv\Scripts\Activate         # Windows
   ```

3. **Install required libraries:**

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Enter the coefficients **c1** and **c2** of the objective function.  
2. Fill in each constraint row with coefficients **a1**, **a2**, and the constant **b** for `a1*x1 + a2*x2 ≤ b`.  
   Leave unused rows blank.  
3. Click **Solve** to compute the optimal solution.  
4. Click **Plot (2D)** to visualize the constraints and optimal point.  
5. Click **Clear** to reset all inputs.

## 📊 Example Run

**Problem**

Maximize  
`Z = 900x1 + 1000x2`  
subject to:
```
11x1 + 9x2 ≤ 9900
7x1 + 12x2 ≤ 8400
6x1 + 16x2 ≤ 9600
x1, x2 ≥ 0
```

**Result (HiGHS Solver Output)**
```
x1 = 360.0
x2 = 420.0
Zmax = 780000.0
Iterations: 2
Status: Optimal
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only **two decision variables** (`x1`, `x2`) for visualization simplicity  
- Constraints must be **≤ type**  
- All variables are **non-negative**  
- No integer or binary decisions  
- Does not display the simplex tableau steps  
- No sensitivity or duality analysis  
- Large coefficients may lead to numerical warnings  
- The 2D plot shows constraint lines and the optimum but not the shaded region
